# November 2019 Testing Infrastructure With Pester

Thanks for visiting my repo. I'm adding some additional content that was discussed during the November 2019 Fort Wayne VMUG meeting.
I've compiled a resource list, many of which I have used myself over the past couple of years. Some of them I wrote or recorded. 

Take a look, make notes and start building infrastructure tests!

## Notes
I was unable to do a live demonstration of the Domain Controller Infrastructure Test due to some unexpected
technical difficulties prior to the presentation. However, I will be adding a recording of a test environment soon.
